The threonine residue is highly conserved and there is a moderate physicochemical difference between threonine and isoleucine. This variant is not present in population databases (ExAC no frequency). This variant has not been reported in the literature in individuals with STK11-related conditions. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 15121768). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function are either unavailable or do not agree on the potential impact of this missense change (SIFT: ""Tolerated""; PolyPhen-2: ""Possibly Damaging""; Align-GVGD: ""Class C0""). In summary, the available evidence is currently insufficient to determine the role of this variant in disease.

Two other alterations at this nucleotide (c.597+1G>A and c.597+1G>C) have also been described in patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (Papp J et al. BMC Med. Genet. 2010; 11:169, Hearle N et al.

This variant was not reported in population based cohorts in the following databases: Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (dbSNP), NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), and 1000 Genomes Project. To date, this alteration has been detected with an allele frequency of approximately 0.01% (greater than 20,000 alleles tested) in our clinical cohort (includes this individual). This nucleotide position is completely conserved on sequence alignment.Using the BDGP and ESEfinder splice site prediction tools, this alteration is predicted to abolish or significantly weaken the native splice donor site, respectively. However, direct evidence is unavailable.Alterations that disrupt the canonical splice donor site are typically deleterious in nature (ACMG Recommendations for Standards for Interpretation and Reporting of Sequence Variations.
